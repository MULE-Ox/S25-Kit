## GitHub Desktop

MULE uses **GitHub Desktop** to easily manage and share files. It helps to ensure that all members have the exact same versions of everything and prevents unwanted changes. Download and install GitHub Desktop here:

https://desktop.github.com/download/

### Cloning Files With GitHub Desktop

After installation, open GitHub Desktop and either skip the login step or, optionally, login if you have an existing GitHub account. If you skip the login, you will be asked to enter your name and email address.

Next, select **Clone a Repository from the Internet...**. In the window that opens, go to the **URL** tab and copy-paste this address into the **Repository URL** field:

```
https://github.com/MULE-Ox/S25-Kit.git
```

The **Local Path** field should default to something like "Documents/GitHub/S25-Kit" - leave this as-is and click **Clone**.

This should place a copy of MULE files in a folder called **S25-Kit**. Make sure you can find it! You only need to perform this cloning procedure once at the beginning of the semester.

### Updating Files With GitHub Desktop

At the beginning of every class meeting, open GitHub Desktop and make sure that it says **S25-Kit** under **Current Repository** in the upper-left corner.

Just below that, look at the column that says **Changes**. If there are any changed files, go to **Branch** in the menu bar and select **Discard All Changes...**.

Once it says "0 changed files" in the **Changes** column, look for a button in the upper-right corner that says either **Fetch origin** 

### Create a "Safe" Folder

Occasionally, we will need individual MULE members to be able to create and change files that exist only in their own **S25-Kit** folder. To do so, simply create a new folder named **storage** inside of **S25-Kit**. GitHub Desktop knows to ignore the contents of this folder when discarding files and syncing updates.

## Max

Cycling 74's **Max** is a critical sound and visual application for MULE. Download and install the newest version here:

https://cycling74.com/downloads

You do not need a license to run files in Max for MULE. If you already have Max installed, make sure that it is updated to version **9.0.4** (or higher).

### File Preferences

After installing Max, go to **Options > File Preferences...** in the menu bar. In the window that opens, click the **+** icon in the lower-left corner. Click the the **choose** button in the new row that appears, then find the **S25-Kit** folder that you cloned from GitHub and click **Open**. Make sure that **Subfolders** is checked for that row.

If you have been in MULE in the past, please remove all folders from previous semesters in File Preferences using the **-** button. This will help prevent conflicts between files.

### Link

Max includes a **Package Manager** to install additional packages that add functionality to the base application. One that we use frequently in MULE to synchronize beats among players is **Link**.

To install Link, open the Package Manager by going to **File > Show Package Manager**. Then, search for Link by Cycling '74 and click the **Install** button. You do not need to **Launch** Link after installing - it will automatically be available where needed in the Max patches that we build.
